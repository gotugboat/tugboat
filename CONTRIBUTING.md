Welcome to Tugboat! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible.

## Code of Conduct
Please make sure to read and observe the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## About
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## All code changes happen through pull requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and clone the repository.
2. Create a new branch using `git checkout -b my-branch-name`.
3. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
4. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
5. Ensure the test suite passes.
6. Make sure your code lints.
7. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/gotugboat/tugboat/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/gotugboat/tugboat/issues/new/choose) on GitHub.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (optionally including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
